noest address subtilties of bistability dynamics bi-introducing a low-level of persistent activity (via the Î²A term), showing that with this term both continuous and intermittent conditions can be accounted for, even cases where the intermittent stimuli are quite short and lead to switching rather than sustaining prior perception.

Vattikuti considers a related mechanism, arguing that
background activity is a plausible because it can account for
outcomes with less fine-tuning than recurrent excitation or particular parameters of MI fatigue.

In a similer vein Shpiro et al 2009 show that the dynamics of bistability are
most consistent with a dynamics dominated by noise. That is, there are much
greater range of parameters where noise rather than drift tends to lead to
perceptual switching in a way consistent with the dynamics of bistability in
human participants.

Lastly, in Li et al 2017, it is shown that oscillations sustained by attentional mechanisms can fit human data quite well. Again, there is some extra input,
in this case from recurrent connections to secondary neurons (the "attention" network). 

In either case the point seems to be that adaptation and mutual inhibition set up the dynamics where oscilation is possible and a third element is required to sustain ongoing oscilation.
