in both the Vattikuti and Li papers, the key change is that the effect of mutual inhibition changes over time. 

In Vattikuti et al 2016 this is accomplished with a MI a "non-local fatigue" (which is actually specific to each weight w_ij between unit i and j).

In Li et al 2017 this is accomplished with a change in "attention" that enhances excitation from a specific input (specific to each unit i).

it seems possible that noise might also help achieve this effect (shpiro 2009)
