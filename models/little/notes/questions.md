Implementation questiosn for MI

- do we determine inhibition as a function of overall input
  to layer or based on some estimate of the strength of
  a scale or rate relative to the others? (i.e. does
  overall activation of a particular scale matter or just that
  a scale is present?) is this well formulated, what
  would the "estimate" really be?
  
- do we use rate and/or scale MI?

- is there adapt/MI present in the spectrum?

- does/how does the object-level mask guide this MI (as proposed)?

- do we really want to use the mangitude, or would 
  accounting for phase be appropriate?
