things that might help frequency:
constrain spread of inhibition
change definition of 1 stream
maybe the number of scales matters? (4 or 5 scales?) - just try a few and see
how it goes, probably

if we don't get it to work, we need to know why

why does adaptation matter with no inhibition for freq?

more tests:
- it's probably worth just plotting build-up
- context stimuli
