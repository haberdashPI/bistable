# Plans

## Research plans

What are the next obvious steps:

test current model with additional stimuli:
  e.g. the pure-tones organized by speech stimuli from stephen david's lab
  "look in to" build-up
  "look in to" context
  examine characteristics of rates

  collect some individual data for some set of pure-tone tasks??

top-down effects: might be a way to start addressing context
unifying NMF with predictive step - might be a way to
  address build-up (or at least understanding this would help get to 
  the bottom of this)

More ambitious/risky steps:

1. use beta-VAE to learn important factors and use these 
    factors as potential sources of mutual-inhibition
