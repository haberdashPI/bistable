simulations plans:

 - run the indvidual bistability models again
	- check on the results in more detail,
	- look at the distribution before running anything further
	- the issue I'm finding is that the distances between
	  frames aren't consistent with the intuition that
	  frames of 1st stimuli should be closer to one another
	  than 12st stimuli, trying to normalize them now...
	- then run a more precise grid

 - run interaction simulation, 3st only, 3 runs (~130 hours)
 - then run hopefully a much smaller set over the parameters that showed
   reasonable bistability on all three stimuli using 10 runs 

 - while this is running, I need to run a simulation with the 
   new stimuli
