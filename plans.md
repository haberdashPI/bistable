# What we've learned
Looks like we can get reasonable bistability
it's just that what counts as "two streams" needs to be redefined.

verify that the 12st is actually "working"

Figure out a reasonable definition based on bandwidth relative
to that of the original stimulus

# Plans:

## store continuous ratio result
so we can vary the threshold after running the simulations

## run both new freq and new cortical, scale interaction

cut them down so they both fit within ~1600 hours

## more tests:
* it's probably worth just plotting build-up
* context stimuli

## things that might help frequency:

### change definition of 1 stream

* start by looking at the ratio of the mask to the original source a 2
* stream should be one that has a low ratio.
* pick a good parameter from the freq level model to start with

### constrain spread of inhibition - try out some parameters
for the mexican hat function and plot them (requires cluster)

### maybe the number of scales matters? 
(4 or 5 scales?) - just try a few and see
how it goes, probably

### if we don't get freq to work, we need to know why
why does adaptation matter with no inhibition for freq?
