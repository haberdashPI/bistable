things that might help frequency:
change definition of 1 stream
	start by looking at the ratio of the mask to the original source a 2
	stream should be one that has a low ratio.
	
	pick a good parameter from the freq level model to start with

constrain spread of inhibition - try out some parameters
  for the mexican hat function and plot them (requires cluster)

maybe the number of scales matters? (4 or 5 scales?) - just try a few and see
how it goes, probably

if we don't get it to work, we need to know why

why does adaptation matter with no inhibition for freq?

more tests:
- it's probably worth just plotting build-up
- context stimuli
