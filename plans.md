# What we've learned
looks like we should be able to record
the ratios

the next step is to actually run my simulation, I will start with the frequency
alone because I can do a very short run (200 hours) and validate the approach.

# Plans:

## run both new freq and new cortical, scale interaction
- [X] cut them down so they both fit within ~1600 hours
- [ ] make it possible to have multiple parameter runs at once??
- [ ] test the freq run

## more tests:
* it's probably worth just plotting build-up
* context stimuli

## things that might help frequency:

### change definition of 1 stream
**DONE**
* start by looking at the ratio of the mask to the original source a 2
* stream should be one that has a low ratio.
* pick a good parameter from the freq level model to start with

### constrain spread of inhibition - try out some parameters
for the mexican hat function and plot them (requires cluster)

### maybe the number of scales matters? 
(4 or 5 scales?) - just try a few and see
how it goes, probably
