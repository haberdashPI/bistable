simulations plans:

 - run the indvidual bistability models again
	- run 0.5st and 12st stimuli now, and verify selectivity
 - run interaction simulation, 3st only, 3 runs (~130 hours)
 - then run hopefully a much smaller set over the parameters that showed
   reasonable bistability on all three stimuli using 10 runs 

 - while this is running, I need to run a simulation with the 
   new stimuli
