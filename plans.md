# What we've learned

- looks like the optimized version is working for all bistable stimuli
- now I'm checking that it doesn't make the 0.5 st and 12 st stimuli
  bistable. seems to work!

- next step, test on a machine with more memory and parallelism (e.g.
  my new laptop) and see if the parallelism in tracking helps at all.
