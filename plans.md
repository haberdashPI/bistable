simulations plans:

 - run the indvidual bistability models again
   - i'm worried we'll loose the information we need to make
     decisions about output. I'm hoping to making a compressed verison
     of the mask as store that during the simulations.
   - re-run all three model tests, and verify 
     sanity, checking plots. 
   - setup a run on the MARCC server, as a test
     of the new infrastructure
   - plot the results
 - run interaction simulation, 3st only, 3 runs (~130 hours)
   - once the individual run has been verified, create the parameters for
     the interaction run and start it.
   - then run hopefully a much smaller set over the parameters that showed
     reasonable bistability on all three stimuli using 10 runs 

In parallel
  - walk through the steps in the notebooks (Buildup and New Stimuli)
    to work on the context stimuli
