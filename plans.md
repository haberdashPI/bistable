# Plans

## Research plans
What are the next obvious steps:

basic approach: justify subsequent innovations on the basis of new
data/stimuli to incorporate into the model

another important question: what would improve the pilot data for my grant?

things I might want the model to handle:

- individual data for aba task?
- fill out the van-noorden diagram: handle ambiguity in temporal rates
- the pure-tones organized by speech stimuli from stephen david's lab (might work with the model now?)
- handle shepard tones (could be pretty straightforward, migth come along with build-up/context)
- bulid-up & context (seems like the most obvious place)

things I might do to help the model handle more:

two broad ways to change: more realistic features / more intra-layer communication

- extend object level to include top-down effects
- follow brascamp's framework to extend layer-to-layer communication

- more data driven object-level (e.g. some sort of NN trained to predict)
- data driven layers - beta-VAE
    - incorporate adapt, inhib, noise into computations? of data-driven layers?
    - if I went this route might make sense to consider just a single trained layer to start with
    could replace earlier layers later on
