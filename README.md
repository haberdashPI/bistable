# Bistability

This is a work-in-progress bistability modeling project. 

- [x] Step 1 - replicate the basic behavior described in [Rankin et al. 2015](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004555)
- [ ] Step 2 - replicate outcomes of Deb's (Chakrabarty) model
  - [x] asynchronous vs. synchronous
  - [x] buildup
  - [ ] [Micheyl et al 2013](https://doi.org/10.1121/1.4789866) data
  - [ ] generate and save pdfs of results
        - [x] asynch
        - [x] buildup
        - [ ] micheyl
- [ ] Step 3 - introduce simple bi-stable components to Deb's model
  - [X] figure out how to generate a continuous response 
        from Deb's model
  - [X] refactor the model to ensure I can modify it with ease
  - [x] create a graph for the continuous response version of the build up
		experiment
        - [x] include a version that breaks down the
              results by frequency
        - [x] do the same for the old approach
        - [x] compare new approach using both ``L_2`` and ``L_1`` norm
  - [X] create a graph to visualize stimulus response in layer1
        - [x] simple - discriminability of a and b
        - [ ] cluster
        - [ ] spectral-temporal modulation filters
  - [ ] introduce adaptation in layer 1
        - [ ] how does first approach affect psychophysical benchmarks
        - [ ] create some graphs, using the normed quanities (not responses)
  - [ ] introduce mutual inhibition in layer 1
  - [ ] introduce noise in layer 1

# Questsions for Deb

0. can you show/send me the clustering work? might be usreful to me (deb will send result data of clusters and the spectral modulation representation of those weights)
1. how are you picking parameters for the auditory spectrogram? (frame rate)
2. what is up with intertia_delta? why modify only the first 4 time points? (to emphasize the target sound, which helps separate it from the non-target)
3. in calc_response_gen_mod why are you calculating visible units and then not using them? (we don't need to use them, but in general for backward pass we would)
4. why subtract the starting value for the buildup experiemnt,
   i know it gives the "right" answers but what is the theoretical
   justification for it? (short answer, there isn't really one, deb just wanted to get a result consistent with the human data)

# Problems/Questions 
1. I noticed that when you plot out the buildup by frequency, there are some
   strange re-orderings of the delta's at the most extreme frequencies, using my
   continuous response setup. Why? NOTE: This happens a little bit in the upper
   frequencies for deb's approach as well, but not as badly.
